# ElasticPhish

Example application using the [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) stack to store and visualize phishing domains detected using the [certstream](https://certstream.calidog.io/) tool for consuming live Certificate Transparency Log data.

The folder contains a working phishing detection tool (prototype) and configuration files for Logstash and Filebeat. The goal of this project was to:
1. Provide a working example of a phishing domain detector
2. Highlight components of the Elastic stack and how they can be used to visualize the intelligence
3. Show the power of CertStream to provide SOC teams additional intelligence on malicious actors

## Installation

#### Python
The script was built using Python 3.7.3, but should work across Python 2 & 3 versions

You will need to first install the following Python libraries: certstream, PyYAML, tld

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### Elastic
Navigate to the Elastic [download](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/) page and download the latest versions of Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Filebeat. At the time of publishing, it is version 7.0.

In the Logstash folder, add the `logstash.conf` file to the `/config/` directory. The config assumes for PoC purposes that you are running on a single machine, so notice the use of localhost. The address can be changed to reflect different containers/vm configurations.

In the Filebeat folder, replace the `filebeat.yml` file with the provided `filebeat.yml`. It is *important* that you modify the path in line 28 to reflect the location where you will be writing the phishing domains to.


#### CertStream
On lines 11 & 12 of the `elasticphish.py` script are two different options for url instantiation. The first connects directly to a CertStream server run by CaliDog. The second is pointing to a local version of the [CertStream Server](https://github.com/CaliDog/certstream-server) running on a local instance. 

It is recommended that you run your own CertStream server to obtain the best performance and reduce downtime. The CaliDog server should be used for testing to ensure that proper setup has been performed.

For instructions on deploying the CertStream Server, refer to the CaliDog Github page.


## Operation

#### Elastic
Refer to Elastic documentation for full configuration and operating commands. The following are simple commands to start each of the processes, and should not be considered and exhaustive explanation.
```
in elasticsearch folder, run: bin/elasticsearch
in kibana folder, run: bin/kibana
in logstash folder, run: bin/logstash -f logstash.conf
in filebeat folder, run: ./filebeat -e -c filebeat.yml
```

#### ElasticPhish Script
```
python elasticphish.py
```


## Phishing Detector
The PoC phishing detection tool is a heuristic engine designed to detect phishing domains that are intended to trick users through the use of common brands and keywords. A list of brands and keywords was built by analyzing a large pool of known phishing domains from sources like PhishTank, OpenPhish, etc. and extracting the common lexicon. 

In addition, the script utilizes the Umbrella 1M list to filter out well known domains, helping reduce false positives. The Spamhaus list of most dangerous TLDs is also added to the `scoring.yml` file to account for known "bad neighborhoods." 

Although this approach is quite generic in complexity, it has been shown to detect over a thousand phishing domains per day from the CertStream feed alone, many of which have not been posted to other threat feeds (e.g. Umbrella, VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing).

The goal of the project was to show how a rich dataset could easily be used to detect emerging phishing domains, often as they are being built, and fully visualized using the Elastic stack. Users can easily replace the existing analytic capability, or supplement, with their own.
